# K-means
The document explains the research carried out with regards to the Kmeans algorithm implemented via different approaches (serialization, multithreading, multiprocessing and multichunking) and its performance on Windows machine. Our project begins with implementing an initial sequential K-means implementation. Following this we review the available literature on the algorithm (implementation, parallelization, use cases). This enables us to conduct an inquiry into parallelization technologies. We explore real-world datasets to which these techniques can be applied, and lastly, we analyze the algorithmâ€™s performance on these datasets.
